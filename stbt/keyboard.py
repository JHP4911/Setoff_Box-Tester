class Keyboard(object):
    """Enter text into an on-screen keyboard using the remote control.

    The constructor takes the following parameters:

    :param stbt.FrameObject page: An instance of a `stbt.FrameObject` sub-class
        that implements the following:

        * ``selection`` â€” property that returns the name of the currently
          selected character, for example "A" or " ".

    :param str graph: A specification of the complete navigation graph (state
        machine) between adjacent keys, as a multiline string where each line
        is in the format ``<start_node> <end_node> <action>``. For example, the
        specification for a qwerty keyboard might look like this::

            Q W KEY_RIGHT
            Q A KEY_DOWN
            W Q KEY_LEFT
            <etc>

        For nodes that enter a character, use that character as the node name.
        For the space-bar use SPACE. For other nodes that don't enter a
        character when pressed use a descriptive name such as CLEAR or ENTER
        (these nodes won't be used by ``enter_text`` but you can use them as a
        target of ``navigate_to``).

    :type mask: str or `numpy.ndarray`
    :param str mask:
        A mask to use when calling `stbt.press_and_wait` to determine when the
        current selection has finished moving. If the search page has a
        blinking cursor you need to mask out the region where the cursor can
        appear, as well as any other regions with dynamic content (such as a
        picture-in-picture with live TV). See `stbt.press_and_wait` for more
        details about the mask.

    :type navigate_timeout: int or float
    :param navigate_timeout: Timeout (in seconds) for ``navigate_to``. In
        practice ``navigate_to`` should only time out if you have a bug in your
        ``graph`` state machine specification.

    #
    #   I don't know how best to support SHIFT (temporary mode change):
    #   - In shifted state KEY_OK will go from "A" to "a". We'd want to use
    #     press_and_wait before we check the new state. But...
    #   - In non-shifted state KEY_OK just enters the letter; the screen doesn't
    #     change otherwise. Currently we don't use press_and_wait here because
    #     typically the text-box where the text appears is masked out (because
    #     some UIs have a blinking cursor there) and there is no change anywhere
    #     else on the screen.
